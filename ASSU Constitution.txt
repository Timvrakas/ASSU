Selected Letters of Acceptance










Preamble to the Constitution
The Signing Statement
[In order to encourage responsible citizenship and the exercise of individual and corporate responsibility on the part of students in the government of student affairs and activities, Stanford University, by approval of this Constitution, authorizes the Associated Students of Stanford University to exercise and discharge major privileges and responsibilities within the framework of policies and regulations established by the University through the President of the University and the Board of Trustees.]1)
Preamble
We, the students of Stanford University, in order to advance our interests, define our responsibilities and to provide for our meaningful participation in the governance of the University, do hereby associate and establish this Constitution. Having received the acceptance of the University and the Board of Trustees, this Constitution shall be respected by University officials, faculty and staff in their dealings with students of the University.[1]
Article I: Name, Scope, Membership, and Independence
Section 1. Name
The name of the organization under this Constitution shall be the Associated Students of Stanford University, hereafter referred to as the “Association.”
Section 2. Membership and Populations
1. All registered students of Stanford University, and only such persons, shall be members of this Association.
2. The following population subsets of the Association shall be defined:
   1. Undergraduate population: All undergraduate members of the Association
   2. Graduate population: All graduate and professional school members of the Association
   3. Association population: All members of the Association
Section 3. Rights of Membership
1. All members of the Association shall also be liable for such fees as this Association may assess. However, all members shall have the right to a full refund of any and all fees paid to the Association.
2. The Association shall enact no legislation respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Association for a redress of grievances.
3. All members of the Association have the right to attend all open meetings of the Association and to view all open records of the Association.
4. The final authority of the Association shall in perpetuity be vested in the members of the Association—the students of Stanford University.
Section 4. Rights of the Accused
An accused member of the Association shall have the following rights. Any judicial body hearing a case against that person shall inform her or him of his or her rights guaranteed under this section at the time she or he is notified of the charges against him or her.


1. To be informed of all the charges and the alleged acts upon which those charges are based.
2. To be allowed a reasonable time in which to prepare a defense.
3. To hear all evidence upon which charges are based, and to answer this evidence through rebuttal.
4. To call witnesses before the judicial body and to confront any other witnesses before the judicial body.
5. To be assured that, unless the defendant asks for an open hearing, any matters of facts which would tend to identify the person or persons involved in a case would be kept confidential.
6. To have an open hearing.
7. To request that any member of the judicial body be disqualified because of prejudice.
8. To be informed of the above rights by proper summons.
9. To be considered innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
10. To be assured that no record of the case is placed on their transcript.
11. To have no person presenting evidence against them sit in judgment of them.
12. In instances of conviction under State or Federal law, the judicial body shall not assess penalties if the circumstances of the case indicate that such penalties would be inequitable to the defendant when imposed in addition to civil or criminal penalties. This limitation shall not apply when the judicial body’s proceedings are deemed necessary by the judicial body to protect the University community from risk or harm. Nothing in this paragraph, however, shall be interpreted as barring or delaying action by the judicial body on a case because a similar charge is pending before a civil court.
Section 5. Representation and Accountability
This Association shall be the sole representative of the entire Stanford student body.
A. Within the University
Only this Association and its designees shall represent the entire Stanford student body, or a population of the Association, in any dealings with other elements of the University.
B. Outside the University
1. Only this Association and its designees shall have the right to represent the entire Stanford student body, or a population of the Association, in non-University affairs.
2. No Association governing body, including the Association legislative bodies, members of the Association legislative bodies, the President, and the Vice President, shall exercise this right in matters not directly affecting Stanford students. A matter shall be construed as directly affecting Stanford students only if there is at least one Stanford student who is affected by the matter.
3. This prohibition may be waived for a specific issue for a one-year period following passage of a referendum in a general election by a two-thirds vote of the appropriate population of the Association specifically authorizing certain Association actions on that specific issue.
Section 6. Independence
1. The Association shall be, except as defined within this Constitution, a body independent from control or suspension by Stanford University. The University shall not have the power to veto legislation approved by any population of the Association and either or both legislative bodies of the Association, except as defined within this Constitution. The finances of the Association shall be independent of the University, except as defined within this Constitution. The Association shall not be considered a branch of Stanford University for the purposes of expenditures and shall not be subject to the restrictions on expenditures that are inherent to Stanford University as an institution of higher education. However, the Association may agree to certain restrictions on its expenditures as a condition of Stanford University’s assistance in collecting student fees.
2. All power of Stanford University within the Association is circumscribed by this Constitution. Any action by Stanford University within the Association not specifically enumerated within this Constitution is a violation of the independence of the Association.
Section 7. Freedom of Information
1. All records of any Association entity must be available for scrutiny by the public with the exception of proprietary business information of Association businesses in such cases that disclosure of the proprietary information would have a substantial negative impact on the functioning of those businesses, financial records for non-funded accounts of organizations banking with the Association, Legal Counseling records, and personnel records of employees. Every other Association organ must allow access to records. This access must be open to all and subject only to administrative requirements to safeguard the information and to provide access in a timely, efficient manner. All information subject to disclosure shall be provided upon request at no cost in a timely and efficient manner. When information requested from the Association is a combination of disclosable and confidential information, the Association shall provide a redacted copy that strives to maximize the public’s access to disclosable information.
2. All meetings of Association legislative bodies, and all meetings of [student][2] bodies in which one or more Association legislators is acting in an official representative capacity shall be open for observation to all members of the Association. Any meeting involving anything related to Association business, offices, issues, or legislation shall be deemed to be a meeting of the Association open to public access whenever a majority of legislators from either chamber of the Association legislative bodies are present. However, meetings of Student Political Parties and their executive committees shall not be subject to the Freedom of Information provisions of this constitution. However, no action taken at such a meeting shall be deemed official unless the meeting is properly convened and noticed according to the terms of this Constitution and any applicable by-laws.
3. Members of the Association shall be given reasonable opportunity to make their views known at all such meetings. 
4. Recordings of all such meetings may be made so long as the act of recording the meeting does not interfere in a substantial way with conducting the meeting.
5. Information regarding the location, time and agenda for all such meetings must be made available in a public place and via email to a list of students interested in such information. This information must be made available at least 24 hours before the meeting is to be held, except as noted elsewhere in this Constitution. The agenda must be specific enough to enable students with an interest in the business under consideration to know when they should appear. These disclosure requirements apply to both full meetings of the Association legislative bodies and to all regular and special committees. The Association shall keep a single calendar online in which meeting information may be accessed.
6. All minutes of meetings of Association legislative bodies, committees of those bodies, and the Executive Committee must be made available in electronic form within seven days of being approved. Such minutes must be extensive enough to allow absent students to understand the business and discussion of the meeting.
7. The groups mentioned in Section 7(2) above may close a meeting to discuss a specific issue if and only if one of the following conditions is met:
   1. [The body must discuss the appointment, the employment, the performance, or the dismissal of an Association member or employee who is neither the President, the Vice President, nor a member of an Association legislative body.][3]
   2. The body must discuss pending litigation.
   3. The body must discuss proprietary business practices, in such case as the public discussion or disclosure of the proprietary business practice would adversely affect the finances of the Association.
1. A proposal for a closed meeting must be submitted to the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Council for their confirmation that the reasons for the meeting truly merit a closed meeting. The Chief Justice must give written permission for a closed session to occur, except as stated as follows. A specific rationale for a closed meeting must be publicly released prior to the beginning of the meeting.
2. A meeting may be closed in emergency circumstances with the unanimous consent of all legislators present.
3. Due to the particular significance of the matter, discussion of the Association’s annual budget must not be closed in any circumstance.
4. Information regarding the general content of a closed meeting and the reason for its closure shall be made available to the public 48 hours in advance of the meeting.
5. During the closed session, the body shall discuss only the issue or issues which caused the meeting to be closed.
Section 8. Amendment
The power to amend this Constitution [which][4] shall in perpetuity be vested in the members of the Association [shall be exercised pursuant to the terms and procedures of Article VII of this Constitution].[5]
























Article II: Legislative Branch
Section 1. Representative Authority
1. The representative authority of the Association shall be vested in the legislative bodies of the Association. 
2. The Student Senate of the Association shall be composed of 30 members and shall be the deliberative legislative body of the Association. It shall represent all students of the Association. Except as detailed or constrained elsewhere in this Constitution, it shall have sole legislative powers over all Association business, legislation, and activities. A member of this body shall be known as a Senator.
3. The Chamber of Councilors of the Association shall be composed of all qualified individuals pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Constitution. This body shall have such powers and responsibilities as are set forth in this Constitution but no role beyond those powers and responsibilities. A member of this body shall be known as a Councilor.
Section 2. Membership of the Association Legislative Bodies
1. The elected members of the Association legislative bodies shall be chosen each year in the Association Spring Quarter General Election.
2. Each elected member of an Association legislative body shall, at the time of her/his election and during her/his continuance in office, be a member of the Association and be committed, at the time of certification of her/his election, to be a member of the constituency s/he represents during her/his term of office.
3. An elected member of an Association legislative body shall cease to be a member of that body upon the event of her/his death, resignation, disqualification, recall, or expulsion.
4. All vacant seats on an Association legislative body shall automatically be open should a general election be called, or a special election involving the relevant Association population.
5. If a member of an Association legislative body loses her/his seat within 28 days of the general or special election in which s/he was elected, the vacancy created by that member shall be filled by the next individual from the party list on which they were elected who was not elected. If no such individual exists, the next candidate from another party list who would have been elected had an additional seat existed in that constituency shall take the vacant seat.
6. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as preventing the Association legislative bodies from enforcing appropriate sanctions against candidates whose actions in seeking office were in violation of the rules governing student elections.
Section 3. Student Senate: Organization and Procedures
A. Election of the Student Senate
1. The thirty members of the Student Senate shall be elected in three constituencies. 
   1. The graduate constituency shall consist of ten seats. This constituency shall represent graduate students, shall be represented by graduate students, and shall be voted on by graduate students. 
   2. The mixed constituency shall consist of ten seats. This constituency represents both graduate and undergraduate students. Its membership may consist of both graduate and undergraduate students. Both graduate and undergraduate students shall vote on its membership.
   3. The undergraduate constituency shall consist of ten seats. This constituency shall represent undergraduate students, shall be represented by undergraduate students, and shall be voted on by undergraduate students.
1. Elections to each constituency shall be by proportional representation via closed party list. Each list nominated for election shall have next to it on the ballot a list of all the parties which nominated that particular slate for office. Each student shall have one vote to cast for one list in each constituency they are eligible to vote upon. If a student is both an undergraduate and graduate student at the time of the election, they may cast one vote in each of the three constituencies. 
2. The winners of the election shall be determined as follows:
   1. In each constituency, each duly qualified party list shall be awarded one seat for every ten percent of the vote that list receives. If after this procedure empty seats remain, such seats will be allocated to the party list that came closest to reaching the next ten percent threshold. This procedure will repeat until all seats have been filled.
   2. If a party list has won more seats than candidates exist on the list, the runner-up party list for the last seat shall receive one additional seat. This procedure shall repeat for additional runners-up as additional unfilled seats exist. 
   3. However, in all circumstances parties that receive less than 10 percent of the vote in a given constituency shall be skipped when allocating seats unless no qualified candidate from any list receiving over 10 percent of the vote has not already been seated.
1. If at any time more than one-sixth of the Student Senate seats are vacant, the Student Senate shall immediately call a special election to fill all vacant seats.
B. Apportionment of votes in the Student Senate
1. The number of voting members at all meetings of the Student Senate shall depend solely on the number of elected members in attendance.
2. No member of the Student Senate in attendance at a meeting of the Student Senate may for any reason be disenfranchised. No vote taken in violation of this rule shall be considered valid. Restricting the right of members of the Student Senate to vote based on attire, behavior, beliefs or any other grounds is prohibited.
3. The presiding officer of the Student Senate shall exercise Speaker Dennison’s rule in the event of a vote when their vote might result in or break a tie.
C. Student Senate Quorum
1. A majority of the regular members of the Student Senate shall constitute quorum to conduct business.
D. Student Senate Term of Office
1. Members of the Association elected and certified as members of the new Student Senate shall meet as the Student Senate Elect within one week after certification by the Student Senate, and at regular intervals thereafter.
2. The Student Senate Elect shall organize itself in a manner similar to that of the Student Senate. Members of the Student Senate Elect shall be ex-officio members of the Student Senate and observers on any body containing a member of the Student Senate. Members of the Student Senate shall be ex-officio members of the Student Senate Elect.
3. The Vice President Elect of the Association shall be the Presiding Officer of the Student Senate Elect.
4. Transition from the Student Senate Elect to the Undergraduate Senate
   1. If the Student Senate Elect was elected by the Association Spring Quarter General Election, then at a date specified by the Student Senate or 14 days before the end of the spring quarter, whichever comes first, the Student Senate and the Student Senate Elect shall dissolve and the former members of the student Senate Elect shall constitute the new Undergraduate Senate.
   2. If the Student Senate Elect was elected in any other election, then within 14 days of certification of the election, the Student Senate Elect shall dissolve and the former members of the Student Senate Elect shall constitute the new Student Senate.
1. The new Student Senate shall meet at least once in the academic quarter during which it was constituted as the Student Senate. At this time, it shall formalize the membership of the Student Senate committees and the appointment of Student Senate officers.
E. Officers of the Student Senate
1. The Vice President of the Association shall preside over the Student Senate during its first meeting.
2. The Student Senate shall choose a President Pro Tem to preside over its meetings. The President Pro Tem may designate one or more Senators to preside in the event of their absence. 
3. The presiding officer over the Student Senate shall exercise Speaker Dennison’s rule in the event that their vote would cause or break a tie.
4. The Majority Leader shall be a Senator and the designated delegation leader of the largest political party in the Student Senate, but shall not be the Pro Tem.
5. The Minority Leader shall be a Senator and the designated leader of the largest political party in the Student Senate that did not see a majority of its members vote to install the winning candidate for Pro Tem. The Minority Leader shall not be the Pro Tem. In the event that no such person exists, the Minority Leader shall be the designated leader of the second-largest political party in the Student Senate. If no such person exists, the Minority Leader shall be the oldest Independent Senator.
F. Removal from the Student Senate
1. A member of the Student Senate may be dismissed from office in the following ways:
   1. The population that the Senator represents may vote to recall the member of the Student Senate.
   2. The Student Senate may by a two-thirds vote expel a member of the Student Senate. Previous notice of the vote to expel a member of the Student Senate must be given at the regular meeting of the Student Senate immediately prior to the meeting at which the expulsion vote takes place. An expulsion vote shall only take place at a regular meeting of the Student Senate, and the member to be expelled shall have the right to speak in her/his defense before the vote takes place.
1. Grounds for dismissal from the Student Senate shall include, but not be limited to, actions which clearly violate the intent of this Constitution, consistent failure to attend regular meetings of the Student Senate, and actions deemed unbecoming a member of the Student Senate. All Senators shall avoid taking part in business, except the certification of elections, in which they have an interest.
G. Special Procedures for Implementation of New Constitutional Provisions
1. The individuals elected to be members of the Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Student Council in the same election as this constitutional provision is approved shall immediately become the first Student Senate-elect and these individuals shall serve as Student Senators. If seats are vacant on the Graduate Student Council following this election, the Student Senate shall have the power to fill its own membership to the full complement of 30 individuals, divided equally between graduate and undergraduate students.
2. Groups with funding previously received from Annual Grants or Special Fees prior to the enactment of this constitutional provision shall be deemed an Annual Grant group for the purpose of this constitution.
H. Graduate Affairs and Undergraduate Affairs Committees
The Student Senate shall establish a Committee on Graduate Affairs and a Committee on Undergraduate Affairs to investigate, advocate, and inform on issues of unique interest to those respective populations. At the discretion of the chair of those committees, Councilors may be invited to also serve on these committees.


Section 4. Chamber of Councilors: Organization and Procedures
A. Selection of the Chamber of Councilors
1. The Chamber of Councilors, being intended to be a source of institutional wisdom, expert counsel, and consultation with a wide variety of perspectives, has no set numerical membership. In order to maximize the diversity of perspectives and expertise present among its membership, it shall neither make nor enforce any meeting attendance requirements.
2. An individual may become a Councilor in their own right through one of the two following mechanisms:
   1. All individuals elected to serve as a legislative or executive officer or representative of this Association shall become a Councilor upon leaving their elected office and shall remain a Councilor for the duration of their time as a member of the Association. However, no individual shall simultaneously serve as part of the ASSU Executive or Student Senate and as a Councilor. Any Councilor who is elected to office in this Association shall be considered on leave from the Chamber of Councilors and shall not be considered a member of the Chamber of Councilors while on leave.
   2. Any member of the Association may be appointed to the Chamber of Councilors by the ASSU President, subject to a majority confirmation vote by the Student Senate. All individuals appointed to the Chamber of Councilors via this mechanism shall remain a Councilor for the duration of their time as a member of the Association.
1. Student groups shall also be represented in the Chamber of Councilors as follows:
   1. A total of fifteen seats in the Chamber of Councilors shall be apportioned to Verified Student Organizations (VSOs) and other groups as follows:
      1. Five seats shall be allocated to the VSOs with the largest current membership on campus, as estimated by the Office of Student Activities and Leadership, or, if such an estimate is unavailable, by an estimate of the ASSU Executive.

All elections for the ratification of amendments to this Constitution shall be held during the fall, winter or spring quarter. In the event of a typographical error in the Constitution, the Association legislative bodies shall have power to correct the error without a vote of the population of the Association, subject to approval of the Board of Trustees or the President of the University.

3. If either Association legislative body has not placed the proposed amendment on the ballot for the specified election by the end of the regular meeting of that body following the meeting at which the notice was given, then petitions proposing that amendment may be circulated by members of the Association to the corresponding population of the Association. All such petitions shall contain the text of the proposed amendment, the population that would be eligible to vote on the proposed amendment, and the parts of the Constitution to be affected thereby.
   1. If such a petition containing the signatures of at least 5 percent of the members of the Association is submitted to the Elections Commission at least 21 days prior to the Association Spring Quarter General Election, or at least 14 days prior to any other general election, the Commission shall place the amendment on the ballot in the election for which the petition was submitted, provided that it finds the petition to be valid. Grounds for the Elections Commission ruling the petition invalid shall include, but not be limited to, an inappropriate choice of population. Either Association legislative body may rule such a petition invalid, but only on the grounds that the choice of population is inappropriate. Petitions covering the entire membership of the Association must bear the signatures of 5 percent of the graduate and undergraduate populations separately.
   2. If such a petition containing the signatures of at least 15 percent of the members of the Association is submitted to the Elections Commission, the Commission shall, within 48 hours after the petition was found to be valid, call an election, involving the relevant population of the Association, on the amendment except as provided below.

Either Association legislative body may rule such a petition invalid, but only on the grounds that the choice of population is inappropriate. Petitions covering the entire membership of the Association must bear the signatures of 15 percent of the graduate and undergraduate populations separately. The Association legislative bodies may not subsequently amend the call of the election. The election on the amendment shall be held not less than 7 nor more than 21 days after the petitions are submitted to the Elections Commission. However, if they are received within 28 days of the end of the quarter, the Elections Commission may hold the election within the first 14 days of the following quarter.
